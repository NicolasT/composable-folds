composable-folds
================

Composable folds using an applicative interface for OCaml.

For a demo, see `demo.ml`. You can validate only one call to `List.fold` is
performed by running `make` and taking a look at `validate.ml` and
`_build/validate.s`.

This is based on work by Gabriel Gonzalez, see http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/08/composable-streaming-folds.html.
